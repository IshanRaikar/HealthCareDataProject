# HealthCareDataProject
Basic project to read healthcare data and output it for easy trend visualization.
- Starts by reading the data from a CSV file
- Inspected the data and reported the structure (missing values/duplicates), then removed duplicates and treated missing values
- Finds the central tendencies and spread of the data
- Identified the categorical variables, then described them using a count plot
- Looks at the correlations between specific variables that seem to have the most impact
- Built a baseline model to predict the risk of a heart attack using logistic regression and random forest
- Uses standard error and p-values from statsmodels library to find results using correlation analysis and logistic regression
